      <p>Good jobs are disappearing. New technologies like robots and AI are great for business, but will quickly displace millions of American workers. In the next twelve years, a third of all American workers are at risk of permanently losing their jobs, a crisis far worse than the Great Depression. If we want a bright future, we have to do something we’ve never done before—and we have to do it now.</p>

    <h3>TOP 5 POLICIES</h3>
    <hr />
  </div>

  <button class="accordion" id="accordion_1"><h3>1. UNIVERSAL<br>BASIC INCOME<br><span style="font-size: 20px;">Learn More ▼</span></h3></button>
<div class="panel" id="panel_1">
  <p class="policy_text">Andrew would implement a Universal Basic Income, ‘the Freedom Dividend,’ of $1,000/month, $12,000 a year for every American adult over the age of 18. This is independent of one’s work status or any other factor. This would enable all Americans to pay their bills, educate themselves, start businesses, be more creative, stay healthy, relocate for work, spend time with their children, take care of loved ones, and have a real stake in the future.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion" id="accordion_2"><h3>2. UNIVERSAL<br>HEALTH CARE<br><span style="font-size: 20px;">Learn More ▼</span></h3></button>
<div class="panel" id="panel_2">
  <p class="policy_text">Access to quality healthcare is one of the most important factors in overall well being, and yet America is one of the few industrialized nations not to provide healthcare for all of its citizens. Instead, we have a private healthcare system that leaves millions uninsured and bankrupts even some of those who do have health insurance.

By providing holistic healthcare to all our citizens, we’ll drastically increase the average quality of life, extend life expectancy, and treat issues that often go untreated. We’ll also be able to bring costs under control and outcomes up, as most other industrialized nations have.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion" id="accordion_3"><h3>3. STUDENT LOAN<br>FORGIVENESS<br><span style="font-size: 20px;">Learn More ▼</span></h3></button>
<div class="panel" id="panel_3">
  <p class="policy_text">Student debt levels have exploded relative to other forms of debt over the past decade in particular. Educational loan totals recently surpassed $1.4 trillion in the U.S., up from $550 billion in 2011 and only $90 billion in 1999. The average level of indebtedness upon graduation is up to $37,172 and there are 44 million student borrowers. Default rates have crept up steadily to 11.2%, and if you include delinquency rates it’s as high as 25%. This is limiting the growth of our economy and also crippling the advancement of millions of young people in their careers and in starting families.

We need to create a clear path out of this crippling debt. Andrew would propose the 10×10 Student Loan Emancipation Act, a plan by which the federal government would buy student loan debt (negotiated rate with the private lenders) and allow students to opt into a plan to repay it through pledging 10% of their salary per year for ten years, after which the balance would be forgiven.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion" id="accordion_4"><h3>4. COMBATTING<br>CLIMATE CHANGE<br><span style="font-size: 20px;">Learn More ▼</span></h3></button>
<div class="panel" id="panel_4">
  <p class="policy_text">Climate change is an existential threat to humanity and our way of life. It should be a top priority of the federal government to implement policies to control anthropogenic climate change while working with other governments to implement these policies throughout the world. It’s important to regulate fossil fuels, both to control climate change and to improve the health of the average American. Renewable energy must be invested in, not only as a means of moderating climate change but also to drive economic growth. However, innovation must also be relied on to reverse the damage already caused.

While the role of the federal government is important, much of the work will be done at the state, or even neighborhood, level. The federal government should support local efforts through funding and market-based incentives.</p>
</div>


<button class="accordion" id="accordion_5"><h3>5. PATHWAY TO<br>CITIZENSHIP<br><span style="font-size: 20px;">Learn More ▼</span></h3></button>
<div class="panel" id="panel_5">
  <p class="policy_text">Immigrants have been a source of hard work and innovation for America over the centuries. Without a doubt, the melting pot of our country has led to the most dynamic, most creative, and most successful nation in the history of the world. It’s also necessary to recognize that, as a nation, we need to maintain control of our immigration system.<br><br>

The current system we have in place, when it works, does a great job of ensuring that highly skilled, hard-working, and invested immigrants can come to this country and integrate, becoming new Americans who contribute greatly to our society. However, because of issues on the southern border, our immigration system has broken down, and we have over 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. While these individuals are generally law-abiding people who work hard and contribute to their local communities, it’s also true that they’re not supposed to be here.<br><br>

Outside of increasing our guest worker program and making sure that those who receive temporary permission to come to the US to work leave when their time is up, we also need to find ways to address this massive community of undocumented immigrants who entered the country illegally. Rounding up and deporting that many people is a nonstarter—it would be prohibitively expensive, disruptive, and inhumane to many communities, so a pathway to citizenship must be provided (after securing our southern border, so that we don’t end up right back where we started). However, this pathway must reflect the fact that these individuals tried to circumvent our legal immigration system. It’s even more important to get this right when citizenship guarantees a Freedom Dividend.</p>
